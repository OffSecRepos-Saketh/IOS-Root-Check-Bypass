Bypassing Root Detection in iOS Apps with “hidejb” and “Liberty”

When an application works on a Jailbroken/rooted device, it grants access to the app’s file system, allowing users to explore folders containing app data. This access can potentially expose vulnerabilities or misconfigurations , SSL pinning issues and other related security vulnerabilities

STEPS TO PERFORM JAILBREAK BYPASS

Install “hidejb” and “Liberty” Modules:
* Start by installing the “hidejb” and “Liberty” applications/modules from Cydia, a package manager for jailbroken iOS device

After Installing HideJB and Liberty from cydia
2.Configure “hidejb”:
* Open the “hidejb” app and enable it.
* Navigate to the Settings tab, then select “hidejb.”
* Enable “hidejb” and choose the target app that you want to bypass jailbreak detection for.

3. Test the App:
* Return to the home screen and open the target app to check if the jailbreak detection has been bypassed.
* If the app still detects the jailbreak, return to the “hidejb” settings and try enabling “Plus + Mode (BETA)” for additional bypass options

4. Configure “Liberty”:
* Next, configure the “Liberty” module.
* Enable “Liberty” and choose the target app.
* In the Liberty settings, enable “Block Jailbreak Detection” for the selected app.

5. Combine “hidejb” and “Liberty” Lets us try a Different Method

* If bypassing jailbreak detection requires both modules:
* Enable the “hidejb” module and make sure that the target app is selected under both normal and beta mode lists.
* Keep the “Liberty” module enabled and confirm that the target app is also selected under its settings.
* Test the app again by returning to the home screen and opening the target app. Check if the jailbreak detection is successfully bypassed

Configure the app in both modules
i was able to bypass in this case

By following these steps, you can attempt to bypass jailbreak detection for iOS apps using the “hidejb” and “Liberty” modules.
